# ChatApp - Decentralized Chat Application

## Vision
ChatApp aims to revolutionize the way we communicate by leveraging blockchain technology to create a decentralized, secure, and transparent chat platform. By using Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, ChatApp ensures that all messages and user interactions are stored securely, free from tampering, and are accessible only to authorized participants.

## Flowchart
Below is a high-level flowchart of ChatAppâ€™s architecture:

1. **User Registration**:
   - User connects their Ethereum wallet.
   - User registers by creating a new profile in the smart contract.

2. **Send Message**:
   - User composes a message.
   - Message is encrypted and sent to the smart contract.
   - Smart contract records the message and associates it with the sender and recipient.

3. **Receive Message**:
   - Recipient requests messages from the smart contract.
   - Smart contract provides the encrypted messages to the recipient.
   - Recipient decrypts messages locally.

4. **View History**:
   - User requests chat history.
   - Smart contract provides historical messages.
   - Messages are decrypted by the user locally.

## Smart Contract Address
The smart contract for ChatApp is deployed at the following Ethereum address:
```
0xAbC1234DeF5678GhIjKlMNoPqRsTuVwXyZ012345
```

## Future Scope
- **Enhanced Privacy**: Implement advanced encryption techniques for message privacy and security.
- **Scalability**: Optimize smart contract to handle a higher volume of messages and users efficiently.
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Extend support for other blockchains to broaden user accessibility.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Develop a more intuitive UI/UX for easier interaction and integration with various platforms.
- **Integration with Decentralized Identity**: Allow users to create and manage decentralized identities for enhanced security and ease of use.
